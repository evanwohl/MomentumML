Our final project for STAT486: Market Models consisted of creating a machine learning model to predict day over day change in close price of various different securities. Originally, we attempted to create a LSTM neural network, however it proved to be ineffective due to issues with redundancy as momentum indicators inherently represent time series data. Thus, we decided to create a random forest regression model and created/backtested a trading strategy based on the results produced.
